wordament-solver
================

This is a simple Wordament solver, written for fun in F#. It's just a late night hack, 
and as such is missing unit tests, makes undocumented assumptions about the input and 
is generally fussy in what it accepts, has a barebones UI, etc. Really, I was just 
curious to see what a Wordament solver would end up looking like.
